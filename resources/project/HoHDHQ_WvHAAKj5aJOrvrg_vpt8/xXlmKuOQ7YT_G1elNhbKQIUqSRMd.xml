<Info description="This document explains the implementation of the Koopman Operator in conjunction with Model Predictive Control (MPC) . A nonlinear dynamic system is controlled by leveraging the linearity of the Koopman operator in a higher-dimensional lifted space. This contribution showcases a control algorithm that can be investigated and simulated nicely using MathWorks tools."/>
